_Recently_  
I presented work on simulating inheritances using survey data and microsimulations at the [2024 annual meeting of the Population Association of America](https://www.populationassociation.org/paa2024/home). You can find the slides [here](files/paa2024_hexel.pdf) and the working paper ~~here~~ (waiting for the link to work).

With [Wenqing Qian](https://conchaespina.github.io/) (and [a](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/ridhi-kashyap) [few](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/about_us_6113/staff_directory_1899/emilio_zagheni_2243) [others](https://ingmarweber.de/)), we published our research on how Weibo's audience demographics (as Weibo understands them) compare to the districts ~~they live in~~ Weibo localizes them in: ["Demographic inequalities in digital spaces in China: the case of Weibo."](https://workshop-proceedings.icwsm.org/abstract.php?id=2023_01). Wenqing is an incoming Ph.D. student in the Michigan Program of Survey and Data Science. You should follow her.

_About me_  
I am a post-doc at the [Max Planck Institute for demographic research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/). I am a member of the [Department of Digital and Computational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/).

Before joining the MPI, I obtained a Ph.D. in sociology from [Northwestern University](https://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/) and the [Observatoire du changement social](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en) at [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en).

My dissertation research analyzes financial transfers from parents to adult children in twenty European countries. 
I use the [Survey of Ageing, Health and Retirement in Europe](http://www.share-project.org/) to examine how the number and gender of sibs influences transfers, which events in the children's lives (unemployment, divorce, childbirth) trigger transfers, and how these transfers evolve over time.

I made something shiny for my students [once](https://ohexel.shinyapps.io/distributions/).
