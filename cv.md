_Peer-reviewed_  
Wenqing Qian, **Ole Hexel**, Emilio Zagheni, Ridhi Kashyap, Ingmar Weber. 2023. ["Demographic Inequalities in digital spaces in China: The case of Weibo"](https://doi.org/10.36190/2023.01). _Workshop Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media_.

> We collected counts of Weibo users according to age, sex, and location from the Weibo advertisement API (where Weibo tells advertisers how many daily/monthly users it thinks it has). Then we compared it with the demographics of the corresponding administrative units. Weibo users tend to be more educated, more often women, and generally younger, than the surrounding population. Weibo usage is also much higher in more populated districts.

> We conducted a meta-analysis of field experiments of racial discrimination in hiring. We found that discrimination against African-Americans in the United States has not changed since 1990 (PNAS article). We also compared discrimination across nine countries (Sociological Science article). We found evidence for discrimination in all countries and against five different minority groups.
