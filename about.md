I am a post-doc at the [Max Planck Institute for demographic research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/). I am a member of the [Department of Digital and Computational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/).

I obtained my Ph.D. candidate in sociology from [Northwestern University](https://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/)  and the [Observatoire du changement social](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en) (now Centre de recherche sur les inégalités sociales) at [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en).

My dissertation analyzes financial transfers from parents to adult children in twenty European countries. 
I use the [Survey of Ageing, Health and Retirement in Europe](http://www.share-project.org/) to examine how the number and gender of sibs influences transfers, which events in the children's lives (unemployment, divorce, childbirth) trigger transfers, and how these transfers evolve over time.
