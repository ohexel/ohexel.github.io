I am a research scientist at the [Max Planck Institute for demographic research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/). I am a member of the [Department of Digital and Computational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in sociology from [Northwestern University](https://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/) and the [Centre de rechere sur les inegalit√©s sociales](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en) (formerly the Observatoire du changement social) at [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en) in 2020.

My dissertation analyzed financial transfers from parents to adult children in twenty European countries. 
I used the [Survey of Ageing, Health and Retirement in Europe](http://www.share-project.org/) to examine how the number and gender of sibs influences transfers, which events in the children's lives (unemployment, divorce, childbirth) trigger transfers, and how these transfers evolve over time.

I also collaborated on a meta-analysis of field experiments of racial discrimination in hiring.
We found that discrimination against African-Americans in the United States has not changed since 1990 ([original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870), [Harvard Business Review summary](https://hbr.org/2017/10/hiring-discrimination-against-black-americans-hasnt-declined-in-25-years)).
We also compared discrimination across nine [countries](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-v6-18-467/).
We found evidence for discrimination in all countries and against five different minority groups.
