My dissertation research analyzes financial transfers from parents to adult children in twenty European countries. 
I use the [Survey of Ageing, Health and Retirement in Europe](http://www.share-project.org/) to examine how the number and gender of sibs influences transfers, which events in the children's lives (unemployment, divorce, childbirth) trigger transfers, and how these transfers evolve over time.

I also collaborated on a meta-analysis of field experiments of racial discrimination in hiring. We [found](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870) that discrimination against African-Americans in the United States has not changed since 1990. We also compared discrimination across nine [countries](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-v6-18-467/). We found evidence for discrimination in all countries and against five different minority groups.
